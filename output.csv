1,"The {} application provides a convenient solution for assigning predefined categories to a given list of short texts. To utilize this functionality, you need to provide two types of inputs in MS Excel (xlsx) format: a list of [id, text] records and a list of [id, category] records.\n\nIn the demo mode, you can explore the application without providing any inputs. A sample dataset is provided, allowing you to experience the classification process firsthand. However, please note that in the current version, the number of records that can be classified is currently limited to {} randomly selected from the full dataset. This limitation is implemented to manage costs effectively.\n\nWith {}, you can streamline the categorization process and effortlessly assign categories to your short texts, simplifying your workflow and saving valuable time.",[4]
